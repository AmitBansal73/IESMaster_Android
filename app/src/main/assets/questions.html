When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are

$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$ so lets see if it converts another one also like $x = {y \over 2a} + \ {Y^2 \ over 7} .$  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.  $sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a.$
